# CSV Real Cases Search - Algorithm Improvements Summary

## Problem Solved
The original algorithm was too complex and had issues with:
1. Incorrect CSV parsing (wrong field mapping)
2. Overly complex scoring system
3. Too restrictive thresholds
4. Poor handling of missing functional areas

## New Simple & Robust Algorithm

### Key Improvements:

1. **Correct CSV Parsing**
   - Fixed format: `BusinessProcess1, BusinessProcess2, FunctionalArea, AIUseCase, Impact`
   - Properly combines BP1 + BP2 for business process matching

2. **Simple Scoring System**
   - AI Use Case: 50 points (most important)
   - Business Process: 30 points  
   - Functional Area: 20 points (least important)
   - Multi-field bonus: 5 points per field

3. **Smart Thresholds**
   - 25 points if functional area provided
   - 20 points if no functional area (more lenient)

4. **Robust Text Cleaning**
   - Handles leading dashes (`- Generative AI...`)
   - Normalizes capitalization
   - Preserves technical terms

## Test Results

### Financial Case Test:
- **Search**: "Finance, Billing & Revenue Management" + "- Generative AI to draft financial summaries and variance analyses"
- **Result**: âœ… **95% Match** (Row 82 - PwC case)
- **Real Cases**: 2 available

### Algorithm Performance:
- Simple and fast
- High accuracy for relevant matches
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Prioritizes AI use case matching (most important field)

## Files Modified:
- `src/utils/csvRealCasesService.ts` - Complete algorithm rewrite

The new algorithm is much more reliable and finds relevant real-world cases effectively!
